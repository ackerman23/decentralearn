# Literature Review: Decentralized Federated Learning, Privacy, and Blockchain

## Introduction

Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is an emerging paradigm that enables collaborative machine learning across multiple participants without central coordination, while preserving data privacy. The integration of privacy-preserving techniques and blockchain technology further enhances the security, transparency, and trustworthiness of federated learning systems. This literature review summarizes key research contributions in these areas.

## 1. Federated Learning

- **McMahan et al. (2017) - Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data**  
  Introduced the concept of federated learning, where model training occurs across decentralized devices holding local data samples, without exchanging them. The FederatedAveraging algorithm is proposed for efficient aggregation.

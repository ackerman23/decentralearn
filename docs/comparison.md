### Detailed Privacy Protocol Implementations

DecentraLearn implements a comprehensive, multi-layered privacy stack with the following protocols:

#### 1. Differential Privacy (DP)
- **Purpose:** Adds calibrated noise to model parameters to prevent inference of individual contributions
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Uses Laplace mechanism for noise addition
  - Configurable privacy budget (ε) with default 1.0
  - Failure probability parameter (δ) set to 1e-5
  - Includes gradient clipping to bound sensitivity
  - Automatic sensitivity calculation between model updates

#### 2. Homomorphic Encryption (HE)
- **Purpose:** Enables computations on encrypted data without decryption
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Uses Paillier cryptosystem
  - Configurable key sizes: 1024, 2048 (default), 4096 bits
  - Supported encryption schemes:
    - Paillier (currently implemented)
    - BFV and CKKS (planned)
  - Enables secure model parameter aggregation
  - Preserves ability to perform computations on encrypted parameters

#### 3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
- **Purpose:** Proves properties about models without revealing actual parameters
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Supports multiple ZKP protocols:
    - zk-SNARKs (default)
    - zk-STARKs
    - Bulletproofs
  - Includes model integrity verification via SHA-256 hashing
  - Validates proofs against specific statements
  - Ensures model compliance without exposure

#### 4. Access Control and Audit Logging
- **Purpose:** Manages and tracks privacy operations
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Centralized privacy control through PrivacyManager
  - Configuration validation
  - Comprehensive audit trail of privacy operations
  - Flexible privacy settings management

#### 5. Secure Aggregation
- **Purpose:** Combines multiple privacy protocols for secure model updates
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Integration of HE with DP
  - Process flow:
    1. Individual model encryption using HE
    2. Secure aggregation of encrypted data
    3. DP noise addition to aggregated result
    4. Decryption only after complete aggregation

### Integration Example
```python
privacy_manager = PrivacyManager(config=PrivacyConfig(
    dp_epsilon=1.0,          # Privacy budget
    dp_delta=1e-5,          # Failure probability
    he_key_size=2048,       # Encryption key size
    he_scheme="paillier",   # Encryption scheme
    zkp_protocol="zk-snark" # Proof protocol
))

# Privacy workflow:
# 1. Apply differential privacy
protected_updates = privacy_manager.apply_differential_privacy(model_updates)

# 2. Encrypt updates
encrypted_model = privacy_manager.encrypt_model(protected_updates)

# 3. Generate and verify proofs
proof = privacy_manager.generate_proof(model, "Model follows training rules")
is_valid = privacy_manager.verify_proof(proof, "Model follows training rules")
```

This comprehensive privacy stack sets DecentraLearn apart from other frameworks by providing an integrated, configurable, and robust privacy solution that can be tailored to specific security requirements while maintaining the effectiveness of federated learning.
